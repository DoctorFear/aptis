            "question3": "Why is reading important for children?",
            "question3_answer": "I suppose that reading brings many benefits to children, especially for children’s thinking and perception. Reading allows them to develop a better imagination and get more life information. When you start reading aloud to your child, you are basically giving them background information about the world, which helps them make sense of what they see, hear and read. In addition, I think reading is also good for children’s health because it helps them limit their exposure to electronic devices."

I spent the day wandering through cobblestone streets, discovering local shops, and indulging in regional cuisine. The highlight was stumbling upon a hidden garden with vibrant flowers and a peaceful atmosphere. It was a refreshing experience, and I enjoyed the blend of history, culture, and nature in that new locale. Exploring unfamiliar places always brings a sense of adventure and discovery.",
            "question3": "Why do people like to go to new places?",
            "question3_answer": "People are drawn to new places for various reasons.

I had to sweep and clean 2 floors and besides, my mother and I had to clean and rearrange the cupboard, bookshelves and 2 wardrobes. The last days of the year are always the busiest, when everything had to be completed and the house also needed decorating. Although those are very tiring and heavy tasks, I found that they helped to strengthen the bonds between family members because we could create many unforgettable times with each other.",
            "question3": "Do you think machines will do all our hard work in the future? Why?",
            "question3_answer": "In my opinion, I don't think that machines can replace humans. Although many labor-saving devices have proved to be very useful in helping us save time and effort when doing housework such as washing the dishes, doing the laundry or vacuuming, I still believe that only humans can do non-standardized tasks. Robots are good at repetitive tasks but lousy at dealing with varied and unique situations. Machines make human skills more important. So, rather than undermining humans, we are much better off thinking hard about how to up skill ourselves and learn how to work."

The train was fairly crowded, but it was still faster than driving because I didn’t have to deal with traffic or finding parking.

They’re involved in their education, health, and hobbies, always wanting what’s best for them. It’s common for parents to sacrifice their own needs to provide better opportunities for their children.
